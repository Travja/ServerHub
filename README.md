# Information

ServerHub is a plugin that was originally made for a server that I like, [Minederp](http://minederp.com). I developed this plugin on my own, and it came out as a very lightweight plugin that can be very beneficial to your server depending on how you use it. At Minederp, we use it so that new players are able to learn their way around the server.

Installing the plugin itself is easy. Just drag the .jar file that you downloaded into your server's plugins folder, and do the same with any addons. Once it's installed, you can start up the server, and use all of the features as you would with any other plugin.
